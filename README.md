# Composables

Similar to mixins

# Env

create env file to the root to automaticly set dotenv
Since the URL is not secret and sensitive data, we can use the publicRuntimeConfig: key.
If it was private, like an API token, youâ€™d want to do this using the privateRuntimeConfig:

const config = useRuntimeConfig();
console.log(config.DATABASE);
